      <h1>Topics appearing in 2019 NSF grant awards, by grantee state</h1>
      <h3>LDA topic modeling was used to analyze the text of grant awards made by NSF.  
        The shading of states by topic reflects the percentage of all awards made to 
        grantees in a state where the award was at least 25% reflective of a given topic.
