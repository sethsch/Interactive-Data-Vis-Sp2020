      <h2>How long did it take governments to initiate policy responses to the pandemic?</h2>
      <p>The global COVID-19 pandemic set off a cascade of responses by governments around the world. For this project, I want to design a tool that hilights developing policy responses to COVID-19 by governments across the globe. I will draw from data from the Coronanet Research Project that's actively being collected by a team of 200+ researchers from around the world, led by NYU Abu Dhabi, TU Munich, Yale University.
        The data yields detailed information about which governments are responding to the coronavirus, who they are targeting the policies toward, how they are doing it, and when they are doing it. It includes information about the level of government responding (e.g. national, regional/state, local/municipal), the types of actions taken, the compliance mechanisms and the timing of policy responses as it relates to the number of confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries. The researchers are publishing the data alongside other relevant country-level political indices such as press freedoms and citizens' perception of corruption, which may yield interesting ways to analyze and curate how policymaking unfolds differently across the globe. </p>
