# Exploratory Project

This dashboard offers a cleveland dot plot that tracks the change in document frequency of keywords in "grant descriptions."
Shown for the selected series are the % of records where the term was mentioned 1+ times, for a selected region and set of years.

The table then shows other terms that collocated with the target term, at the paragraph level, as a percentage of times that the target term appeared and the collocates (or, keywords-in-context terms, KWIC terms) were also present. 

Since the main dot plot shows document/record-level frequencies and does not scale number of mentions (e.g. a record with 100+ mentions of a term is counted the same as a record with only a single mention), the additional dot plot gives an idea of the total mentions of the target term, by year and region.

## Utility:

This type of dashboard can be useful for scoping out subsets of records in large, qualitative datasets.

Term frequency data, pivotted by year and region, offers an estimate of possible trends to read for in the data.

Collocations data gives a bird-eye view of the type of connected themes, actors, ideas that one might encounter while reading in detail for deeper qualitative analysis.

Seeing collocations data by year gives a quick sense of whether contexts for certain keywords changed over time.
